# Flutter Todo application
A Flutter To-Do application built using the clean architecture concept, leveraging `flutter_bloc` for state management<br/>

#### First, we need to generate the necessary files for `objectbox` (Dart native database) and `mockito` (mock test files) using the following command <br/>
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```
#### To run application: <br/>
```bash
flutter run
```

#### To run unit test: <br/>
```bash
flutter test
```

#### To run integration test: <br/>
```bash
flutter test integration_test/*
```
